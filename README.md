-Creating the game itself was pretty easy, although later I realized I didn't need all these classes
and I wasted time creating them. When I got to the point of writing save/load codes, I had to refactor
my classes and modules and that took a lot of time with bunch of testing (I had to test a bunch because
I have never played with serialization, although I did skim through the required reads on it). All in all,
it's finished, and I like the look of everything except for modules.rb, because it is quite long.
