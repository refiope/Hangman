-Project started Mar. 14th
-Project finished Mar. 15th
-Creating the game itself was pretty easy, although later I realized I didn't need all these classes
and I wasted time creating them. When I got to the point of writing save/load codes, I had to refactor
my classes and modules and that took a lot of time with bunch of testing (I had to test a bunch because
I have never played with serialization, although I did skim through the required reads on it). All in all,
it's finished, and I like the look of everything except for modules.rb, because it is quite long.
-Project cleaned Mar. 16th
-I splitted the play_loop function in lib/modules.rb, and got rid of some unnecessary codes inside module. As I have said before on other OOP projects, I doubted how I went about coding this project, and my doubt became solidified. I should not have put all the methods in a module, and instead put most of them inside classes and make them private. I kind of obsessed over making classes look really short and clean, and it does look pretty good if you only look at codes in lib folder, but in the future, as I deal with bigger projects, I think my approach was wrong. I'll try to change this in the future projects.
